# pixel art maker project
Basically my final project on my front end web track course for Udacity courtesy of Google Africa Scholarship

## Description
A game built with html, css and javascript

### How it works
HTML gives the game its framework and CSS provides the necessary colors and styles

Javascript interacts with the DOM and changes any pixel box selected from its default to color to an assigned color in order to make the game highly interactive and fun
